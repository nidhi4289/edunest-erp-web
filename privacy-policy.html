    <h1>Privacy Policy - EduNest ERP</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> [Update this date]</p>

    <p>
      EduNest ERP ("we", "our", "us") provides a school management and communication platform
      for educational institutions, teachers, students, and parents. This Privacy Policy explains
      how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our mobile and web applications.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Depending on how your school uses EduNest ERP, we may collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account and Profile Information:</strong> Name, phone number, email address, role (student, parent, teacher, admin), class and section, and school information.</li>
      <li><strong>Authentication and Device Information:</strong> Login credentials (hashed), device identifiers, Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) tokens, operating system, app version, and IP address.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Information:</strong> Actions performed in the app (such as viewing homework, marking attendance, sending notifications) and timestamps.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and operate the EduNest ERP platform for participating schools.</li>
      <li>Authenticate users and secure access to school data.</li>
      <li>Send notifications such as homework, announcements, attendance updates, and reminders.</li>
      <li>Maintain and improve the performance, reliability, and security of the service.</li>
      <li>Comply with applicable laws and regulations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We do not sell personal data.</p>
    <p>We may share information with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>School Administrators:</strong> who manage student, parent, and staff records.</li>
      <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> such as cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS) and Firebase services used for authentication, push notifications, and analytics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All service providers are required to handle data securely and only for the purposes described above.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We implement technical and organizational measures to protect data, including encryption in
      transit (HTTPS), restricted access to production systems, and regular monitoring of our services.
      However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee
      absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      We retain data for as long as a school continues to use EduNest ERP or as required by applicable
      law. When a school stops using the platform, data is retained only for a limited period or removed
      in accordance with contractual and legal requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parents, students, or staff members who wish to request access, correction, or deletion of their
      data should contact their school administrator or reach out to us using the contact details below.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      EduNest ERP may be used by or on behalf of students, including children under the age of 13, under
      the direction and authorization of schools and parents. We collect only the minimum information
      necessary to provide the service and rely on the school’s authority to process student data for
      educational purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>7. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location, data may be stored on servers located in other countries. We take steps
      to ensure that data is handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable data protection laws.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an
      updated effective date. We encourage you to review this page periodically.
